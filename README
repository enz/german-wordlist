This project contains a list of German words for wordgames.

The list is currently used by Tanglet (https://gottcode.org/tanglet)
but could be useful for other wordgames.

The list is sorted, contains one word per line, the encoding is UTF-8.
The rules what words are included roughly follow the rules in Scrabble,
which means that names, proper nouns, toponyms, abbreviations, archaic
words and outdated spellings are not allowed. Dated words are ok, also
regional words as long as they are known to some extent outside the region.
Extreme cases of obscenities should be omitted.

Note that goal of this list is not to reproduce the official tournament
wordlist of Scrabble Deutschland e.V. The inclusion criteria are less strict.
If in doubt, words should be included, because Tanglet's gameplay works better
with false positives than false negatives. If a word is listed in the Duden
or the official Scrabble Deutschland wordlist and does not violate the general
Scrabble rules, it should always be included of this list.

For easier maintenance, there is a blacklist file that can be used to filter
out unwanted words from a file with new word candidates. The wordlist and
blacklist are far from being complete and still contain a lot of mistakes.
Any help for improving them is appreciated.
