This project contains a list of German words for word games.

The list is currently used by the Tanglet (https://gottcode.org/tanglet)
but could be useful for other word games.

The list is sorted, contains one word per line, the encoding is UTF-8.

The rules what words are included roughly follow the rules in Scrabble,
which means that names, proper nouns, toponyms, abbreviations, archaic
words and outdates spellings are not allowed. Dated words are ok, also
regional words as long as they are known to some extent outside the region.
Extreme cases of obscenities should be omitted.

For easier maintenance, there is a blacklist file that can be used to filter
out unwanted words from a file with new word candidates.

The word list and blacklist are far from being complete and still contain
a lot of mistakes. Any help for improving them is appreciated.
